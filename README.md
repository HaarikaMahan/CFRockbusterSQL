# Rockbuster Stealth LLC.

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Their management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service.  

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data driven answers that they can use for their company strategy. Here are the main questions they'd like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Context
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, data is queried by using SQL. Throughout this project SQL is used to answer increasingly complex business questions. The results of the analysis will be presented to the Rockbuster management. Here is the visualization of the data analysed with insights.
